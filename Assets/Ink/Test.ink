Hello Player #speaker:Narrator
Welcome to the tragic lands of Sorrowmire. Here, the air is filled with gloom and gunk. Can you smell the sadness?
We used to be a happy kingdom, really. There was laughter and joy everywhere you looked, with flowers of all colors blooming from the fresh grass. Happiness cascaded upon people's shoulders, vibrant light was in their eyes...
Now, everything's dried up, including our happiness. But one person has managed to maintain their sense of silliness. The jester! Yes, yes, he's a silly little fellow. He brings joy to the king and his court everyday in order to convince them to have the will to put on a smile and go about official business.
Day, after day, after day. How does he do it without falling prey to the all-consuming sadness of our land? Good thing he'll never succumb to sorrow. Anyways, you'll follow him around today. Have fun.
