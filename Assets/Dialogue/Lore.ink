Hello Player #speaker:Narrator #splash:after
Welcome to the tragic lands of Sorrowmire. Here, the air is filled with gloom and gunk. Can you smell the sadness?
We used to be a happy kingdom, really. There was laughter and joy everywhere you looked, with flowers of all colors blooming from the fresh grass. Happiness cascaded upon people's shoulders, vibrant light was in their eyes... #splash:before
Now, everything's dried up, including our happiness. But one person has managed to maintain their sense of silliness. #playSound:Bad
The jester! Yes, yes, he's a silly little fellow. He brings joy to the king and his court everyday in order to convince them to have the will to put on a smile and go about official business. #splash:him
Day, after day, after day. How does he do it?
Well, it's not my problem. Good thing he'll never succumb to the sorrow. Anyways, you'll be following him around today. Have fun. #splash:sad
